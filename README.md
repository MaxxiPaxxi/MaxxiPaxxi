## Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilien Bohm. I am a newly-graduated student in Artificial Intelligence with a great interest in Computer Science and Mathematics and Future Technologies.<br>
I am highly interested in the advantages of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models and Infrastructures.<br>
I recently graduated in September 2024 after finishing a end-of-studies internship of a duration of 6 months working on developping Retrieval-Augmented Generation solutions for [Orange](https://www.orange.com/en).<br>
During my time at Orange, I studied the state of the art in Retrieval techniques and explored the usage of different Knowledge Bases (Vectorized knowledge bases and Knowledge Graphs).<br>
Moreover, I contributed on different projects to promote my team's place within the department while developing my skills in infrastructure, coding and team-working.<br>

Having closely followed the developments in LLMs and Generative AI, I aim to work in a relatively large organization where collaboration is encouraged and where I can contribute to a motivated team. I have a great interest in Mathematics and in Generative AI and am eager to challenge myself with promising new technologies.<br>
I work towards following up with the trends and developments in AI Research and wish to work with people who share the same passion as I have for the field of Generative AI.<br>

I have lived for 12 years in France, 5 years in Sweden and 6 years in the UAE and consider these life experiences to hopefully be valuable to corporations with global footprints.<br>
I am currently seeking a job following my graduation in the fields of Generative AI to further improve my skills in the theoretical aspect of Artificial Intelligence. 
I am highly motivated by theory and technical implications and seek to join R&D departments in developping state of the art technology.<br>
Having worked and studied RAG and LLMs I seek to integrate positions where I can improve the understanding, reasoning and inherently the capacity of Large Language Models.
Cultural exchange is an important aspect for me, therefore I am seeking for global corporations with opportunities in foreign countries.

## Projects

I am currently teaching myself my way around Arch Linux and setting up my environment. I have some projects on the Linux Kernel, especially fixing firmware driver issues with my Laptop
I have been working on Linux for 5 years now and know my way around the Linux Kernel, Infrastructure and the Linux Terminal with some limited knowledge in Shell scripting. Moreover, I have experience in Software as a Service (SaaS) and Cloud Computing mostly directed towards Google Cloud Platform.

Furthermore, I dedicate part of my time in reading published research articles on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) and understanding current advances.

## Programming Languages

I have some experience in programming and studying algorithms.
My programming experience includes proficiency in Python, Java, HTML&CSS and moderate proficiency in C. I have started learning Rust and Functional Programming Languages such as Haskell and it's GHC compiler.

## Languages

I speak fluently French, English and Swedish. Furthermore, I have intermediate profiency in Italian and Arabic.
