## Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilien Bohm. I am a student in Mathematics and Physics with a great interest in Computer Science and more specifically Quantum Computer Technologies.

## Summary

I am looking to develop my skills in artificial intelligence and visual processing.
For my professional goals, I will study Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Visual Computing as an entrance point towards work involving super computers and system integration. My end-goal is to work in the development of hardware for quantum computers. I am particularly interested by the IBM QX Architecture and would like to work on superconducting qubits circuit design.
As for my personal goals, I intend to discover new environments while keeping in touch with my French and Swedish roots.
I have an interest in many different fields and never fear entering a new field in order to develop my curiosity. I am as well open to new experiences and enjoy learning from experience.

## Projects

I am currently teaching myself my way around Arch Linux and setting up my environment. I have some projects on the Linux Kernel, especially fixing firmware driver issues with my HP Pavilion Laptop.
I have been working on the Linux Kernel for 4 years now and know my way around the Linux Kernel and the Linux Terminal with some limited knowledge in Shell scripting.

## Programming Languages

I have some experience in programming and studying algorithms.
My programming experience includes proficiency in Python, Java, HTML&CSS and moderate proficiency in C. I have started learning Rust and Functional Programming Languages such as Haskell and it's GHC compiler.

## Languages

I speak fluently French, English and Swedish. Furthermore, I have intermediate profiency in Italian and Arabic.
