# Maximilien Bohm

## Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilien Bohm. I am a student in Mathematics and Physics with a great interest in Computer Science and more specifically Quantum Computer Technologies.

## Summary

Having been accepted in the Master of Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Visual Computing at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, I am looking to develop my skills in artificial intelligence and visual processing.
As for my professional goals, I will study Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Visual Computing as an entrance point towards work involving super computers and system integration. My end-goal is to work in the development of hardware for quantum computers. I am particularly interested by the IBM QX Architecture and would like to work on superconducting qubits circuit design.
As for my personal goals, I intend to discover new environments while keeping in touch with my French and Swedish roots.
I have an interest in many different fields and never fear entering a new field in order to develop my curiosity. I am as well open to new experiences and enjoy learning from experience. I enjoy playing all kinds of sports including handball, football, tennis, badmington and more.
I have lived in France, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates; envirronments which stimulated me into learning new languages and cultures.
Most people would describe me as a very curious person who doesn't tend to let something go. I have been known to occasionally live inside my bubble to reflect on some ideas I have had. Another word people would use to describe me is spontaneous. I have a tendency to follow where my curiosity leads me, which leads me to seem spontaneous in my actions even though I might have had planed such actions.

Having grown up in an environment of highly successful engineers, I have understood that any problem can be solved in many different ways and there is always a simpler way to solve it. Furthermore, it helped me to show the benefit of teamwork.
Out of my experience working on projects with my family, I enjoyed more working in a team than on my own. It also taught me to channel my curiosity into productive manners in order to solve problems at hand. Equipped with a pen, a screwdriver and paper, nothing is left unsolvable.

## Interest Areas

My interests include:
Artificial Intelligence, Aerospace Engineering, Quantum Computers, Quantum Field Theory, Cosmology, Linux, Embedded Systems and IBM QX Architecture.

## Projects

I am currently teaching myself my way around Arch Linux and setting up my environment. I have some projects on the Linux Kernel, especially fixing firmware driver issues with my HP Pavilion Laptop.
I have been working on the Linux Kernel for 4 years now and know my way around the Linux Kernel and the Linux Terminal with some limited knowledge in Shell scripting.

## Programming Languages

I have some experience in programming and studying algorithms.
My programming experience includes proficiency in Python, Java, HTML&CSS and moderate proficiency in C. I have started learning Rust and Functional Programming Languages such as Haskell and it's GHC compiler.

## Languages

I speak fluently French, English and Swedish. Furthermore, I have intermediate profiency in Italian and Arabic.
