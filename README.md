## Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilien Bohm. I am a student in Artificial Intelligence with a great interest in Computer Science and Mathematics and Future Technologies.
I am highly interested in the advantages of Artificial Intelligence, Alternative Computing and Distributed Computing.
I expect to graduate in September 2024 after finishing a end-of-studies internship of a duration of 6 months. 
My professional goal is to work in the field of AI and on state of the art technology. I have a great interest in Mathematics and in AI model architecture and am eager to challenge myself with promising new technologies. 
I have lived for 10 years in France, 5 years in Sweden and 6 years in the UAE and consider these life experiences to hopefully be valuable to corporations with global footprints.
I am currently seeking a end-of-studies internship (6+ months) in the fields of AI to further improve my skills in the theoretical aspect of Artificial Intelligence. I am highly motivated by theory and technical implications and seek to join R&D departments in developping state of the art technology.

## Projects

I am currently teaching myself my way around Arch Linux and setting up my environment. I have some projects on the Linux Kernel, especially fixing firmware driver issues with my Laptop
I have been working on the Linux Kernel for 4 years now and know my way around the Linux Kernel and the Linux Terminal with some limited knowledge in Shell scripting.

## Programming Languages

I have some experience in programming and studying algorithms.
My programming experience includes proficiency in Python, Java, HTML&CSS and moderate proficiency in C. I have started learning Rust and Functional Programming Languages such as Haskell and it's GHC compiler.

## Languages

I speak fluently French, English and Swedish. Furthermore, I have intermediate profiency in Italian and Arabic.
